## Problem Statement
A share-bike company wants to understand the factors that impact the rental of their bikes, and predict the demand for their bikes under different conditions. Specially, they want to know:

- which features are significant in predicting the demand for their shared bikes?
- how the demand is correlated to the above factors?

For this purpose, a dataset of the share-bike rentals are provided containing the count of rental bikes for different values of features including temperature, humidity, wind speed, year, month, season, holidays, etc.

The objective is to analyse the data, develop a linear regression model, if applicable at all, and advise the business with feedback on the above business problems.
